        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In botany, succulent plants, also known as succulents, are plants with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and
            engorged,
            usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. It is a characteristic that is not used
            scientifically for
            the definition of most families and genera of plants because it often can be used as an accurate
            characteristic only at
            the single species level. The word succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning 'juice', or 'sap'.[1]
            Succulent
            plants may store water in various structures, such as leaves and stems. The water content of some succulent
            organs can
            get up to 90â€“95%.[2] Some definitions also include roots, thus geophytes that survive unfavorable periods by
            dying back
            to underground storage organs may be regarded as succulents. In horticultural use, the term succulent is
            sometimes used
            in a way that excludes plants that botanists would regard as succulents, such as cacti. Succulents are often
            grown as
            ornamental plants because of their striking and unusual appearance, as well as their ability to thrive with
            relatively
            minimal care.</p>

        <p>Many plant families have multiple succulents species found within them (more than 25 plant families).[3] In
            some
            families, such as Aizoaceae, Cactaceae, and Crassulaceae, most species are succulents. The habitats of these
            water-preserving plants are often in areas with high temperatures and low rainfall, such as deserts.
            Succulents have the
            ability to thrive on limited water sources, such as mist and dew, which makes them equipped to survive in an
            ecosystem
            that contains scarce water sources.</p>
